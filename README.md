# ToDoList
Welcome! This is a basic ToDo list that I created for a job application.
It is developed with Vue 3 and the Composition API, using a Vuex store. The basic functions are:

    - Creating a task

    - Marking it as done

    - Deleting it from the list

The KAFIGTHER account was only used to create this repository. I am only working with the KevinHanstein account on this.
